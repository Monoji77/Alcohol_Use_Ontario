  abstract = {Background
  Although physical activity is widely recommended for reducing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risks, female individuals consistently lag behind male individuals in exercise engagement.
  Objectives
  The goal of this study was to evaluate whether physical activity derived health benefits may differ by sex.
  Methods
  In a prospective study of 412,413 U.S. adults (55% female, age 44 ± 17 years) who provided survey data on leisure-time physical activity, we examined sex-specific multivariable-adjusted associations of physical activity measures (frequency, duration, intensity, type) with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality from 1997 through 2019.
  Results
  During 4,911,178 person-years of follow-up, there were 39,935 all-cause deaths including 11,670 cardiovascular deaths. Regular leisure-time physical activity compared with inactivity was associated with 24% (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.73-0.80) and 15% (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.82-0.89) lower risk of all-cause mortality in women and men, respectively (Wald F = 12.0, sex interaction P < 0.001). Men reached their maximal survival benefit of HR 0.81 from 300 min/wk of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, whereas women achieved similar benefit at 140 min/wk and then continued to reach a maximum survival benefit of HR 0.76 also at ∼300 min/wk. Sex-specific findings were similar for cardiovascular death (Wald F = 20.1, sex interaction P < 0.001) and consistent across all measures of aerobic activity as well as muscle strengthening activity (Wald F = 6.7, sex interaction P = 0.009).
  Conclusions
  Women compared with men derived greater gains in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk reduction from equivalent doses of leisure-time physical activity. These findings could enhance efforts to close the “gender gap” by motivating especially women to engage in any regular leisure-time physical activity.}
