5. 5.1 SAMPLE DESIGN Target population The CCHS covers the population 12 years of age and over living in the ten provinces. The three territories are covered over two years of collection. Excluded from the survey's coverage are: persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements in the provinces; full-time members of the Canadian Forces; youth aged 12 to 17 living in foster homes; the institutionalized population; and persons living in the Quebec health regions of Nunavik and Terres-Cries-de-laBaie-James. Altogether, these exclusions represent less than 3% of the target population. 5.2 Health regions For administrative purposes, each province is divided into health regions (HR) and each territory is designated as a single HR. Statistics Canada is sometimes asked to make minor changes to the boundaries of some of the HRs to correspond to the geography of the Census, or to better account for the health data needs determined by the new geographic boundaries. For CCHS 2018, data was collected in over 100 HRs in the ten provinces, as well as in one HR per territory (Appendix C). 5.3 Sample size and allocation To provide reliable estimates for each HR given the budget allocated to the CCHS component, it was determined that the survey should consist of a sample of nearly 130,000 respondents over a period of 2 years. Starting in 2015, the samples for the youth population aged 12 to 17 and the adult population aged 18 and over are treated separately. Based on the historical sample sizes, 4Optional content will be included in the 2017-2018 data file if it is asked of respondents in a province or territory during the two year period. Otherwise, it will only be included in the file of the year in which it was collected. Note that if a one-year theme content module is selected for the optional content of a jurisdiction during the second year, the module will be included in the two-year data file and will be processed as optional content. 5One-year theme content is not available for the territories unless they have selected that module in their optional content selection for the other year. 9  10  120,000 of the 130,000 respondents were allocated to the adults’ population and about 10,000 to the youth population. Although producing reliable estimates for each HR was a primary objective, the quality of the estimates for certain key characteristics at the provincial level was also deemed important. Therefore, the sample allocation strategy, consisting of three steps, gave relatively equal importance to the HRs and the provinces. In the first step, a minimum size of 500 respondents per HR was imposed. This is considered the minimum for obtaining a reasonable level of data quality. However, due to response burden, a maximum sampling fraction of 1 out of 20 dwellings was imposed to avoid sampling too many dwellings in smaller regions also targeted by other surveys. Note that very few HRs have a size lower than 500 due to limit of the sampling fraction. In the first step, provinces and territories are treated separately. A sample of 117,000 respondents is allocated to the provinces and 3,000 respondents are allocated to the territories. Within each group, the sample is allocated using a 0.75 power allocation based on the population size. Table 5.1 gives the targeted sample sizes for 2018 and 2017-2018. Note that the sample size and allocation for the territories only allow for representativeness over a two year period. Table 5.1 Number of health regions and targeted sample sizes by province/territory, 2018 and 2017-2018   Adults Youth Province Number of HRs Target sample size 2018 Target sample size 2017-2018 Target sample size 2018 Target sample size 2017-2018 Newfoundland and Labrador 4 1,586 3,172 157 313 Prince Edward Island 1 1,058 2,115 111 221 Nova Scotia 4 2,486 4,971 193 385 New Brunswick 7 2,091 4,182 164 328 Quebec 16 12,402 24,804 948 1,896 Ontario 36 18,177 36,354 1,516 3,032 Manitoba 5 2,902 5,803 261 522 Saskatchewan 11 2,564 5,128 226 453 Alberta 5 6,992 13,984 587 1,175 British Columbia 16 8,194 16,389 629 1,259 Yukon 1 518 1,037 99 199 Northwest Territories 1 1,129 99 199 564 Nunavut 1 417 834 Canada 99 108 59,951 119,901 5,090 199 Then, within each province, the sample is allocated to the HRs using a 0.35 power allocation based on the size of the population of the HR. Note that the sample sizes obtained are then inflated to compensate for non-response and out-of-scope units. This inflated sample size is called the raw sample size and corresponds to the number of dwellings that need to be sampled to obtain the required number of respondents. Sample sizes by HR are available in Appendix D for 2018. 10,181 5.4 Frames, household sampling strategies The CCHS sample is selected using different frames according to the age group. For the adult population (18 years and older), the sample of households is selected from an area frame. For the youth population (12 to 17 years old) a list frame is used to select persons.  5.4.1 Sampling of households from the area frame for the adult population 5.4.1 Sampling of households from the area frame for the adult population   The area frame used by the Canadian Labour Force Survey (LFS) is used as a sampling frame for the adult population. The LFS uses a two-stage sample design6. In the first stage, a sample of primary sampling units (PSUs), corresponding to geographical regions called clusters, is selected. In each selected PSU, a sample of dwellings is drawn at the second stage. The details about the area frame and the LFS sample design can be found here  https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/71-526-x Sampling of households from the area frame in the provinces The provinces are divided into clusters, geographic regions generally formed of 100 to 600 dwellings. Each cluster is assigned to one of the six LFS rotation groups, and clusters are grouped into homogeneous, mutually exclusive, geographic or socio-economic groups called strata. The area frame contains all of the PSUs and their corresponding stratum. In the first stage of sampling, a sample of clusters is drawn from each stratum. In the second stage, dwelling lists are prepared for each selected cluster, and dwellings are selected from these lists through systematic sampling.   Each cluster is divided into a set of starts, to allow for systematic sampling of dwellings within each cluster. For example, a cluster of 300 dwellings could be divided into 20 starts. On a list where the 300 dwellings are sorted according to the location of the dwellings, the first start would correspond to dwellings #1, #21, #41, …, #281, the second start would correspond to dwellings #2, #22, #42,…, 6Except for Prince Edward Island where a stratified Simple Random Sample design is used.   11 #282, and so on. The sample size provided by a given start (15 dwellings in this case) is called the yield of the start. The division of clusters into starts was done at the time of the latest LFS redesign in 2015, and the expected yield of each start was computed at that time. When a cluster is first selected by a survey, an updated list of the dwellings found in that cluster is defined. By applying the sampling rate that had been determined at the time of the LFS redesign to the latest count of dwellings, a more precise expected yield can then be obtained for the starts of the cluster.  Knowing the expected yield of each start, the objective of the CCHS sample reservation process is to determine how many starts have to be selected in each LFS stratum, in order for the expected yield to be large enough to obtain the allocated sample size for each of the CCHS strata. When selecting starts from a given LFS stratum, the same number of starts has to be selected within each of the six LFS rotation groups, meaning that the number of selected starts is always a multiple of six7.  The LFS strata and the CCHS strata have different geographic boundaries, meaning that starts selected from a given LFS stratum can provide sample to different CCHS strata. Since we ensure that the total expected yield within each CCHS stratum will be at least the required sample size, and that starts are selected in groups of six, the total expected yield obtained from the selected starts will, aside from exceptions, typically exceed what is needed for each of the CCHS strata. When this is the case, a sub-sample of dwellings is selected within each CCHS stratum through a process called stabilization, in order to have a final sample size that corresponds to the target sample allocation for each CCHS stratum. Sampling of households from the area frame in the three territories For operational reasons, the LFS area frame sample design for the three territories was different. For each territory, the larger communities each have their own stratum while smaller communities are grouped into strata based on various characteristics (population, geographical information, proportion of Inuit and/or Aboriginal persons, and median household income). The LFS defined six design strata in the Yukon, ten in the Northwest Territories and ten in Nunavut. For strata consisting of a group of communities, the first stage of selection consisted of randomly selecting one community with a probability proportional to population size within each design stratum. Then, within the selected community, the second stage consisted of selecting households using the same sampling strategy as the one described above. The CCHS selected its sample from the same communities sampled by the LFS, while ensuring that different dwellings were selected. If too many or too few dwellings were available for a community within a stratum, another community was selected for the CCHS. For larger communities with their own stratum, only one stage design was necessary where households were selected directly using the same sampling strategy described above. 7A few LFS strata have two or three clusters for each rotation group, meaning that starts will come in groups of 12 or 18. 12 It is worth mentioning that the frame for the CCHS covered 94% of the targeted population in the Yukon8, 96% in the Northwest Territories and 93% in Nunavut9.  5.4.2 Sampling of persons from the list frame for the youth population To sample persons for the youth population between the ages of 12 and 17 years old, the CCHS uses a list frame created from the Canadian Child Benefit (CCB) files. The CCB files contain a list of all program beneficiaries with their names, addresses and phone numbers. This list is used to select directly the youths who will be interviewed over the phone. 5.5 Sample allocation over the collection periods In order to balance interviewer workload and to minimize possible seasonal effects on estimates, the initial sample size for each frame is allocated equally over the four 3-month collection periods. In the area frame (adults), each PSU selected within each HR was randomly assigned to a collection period accounting for a number of constraints related to field operations or weighting, while maintaining a uniform size for each period.  For the sample of youth selected from a list, independent samples were selected in each collection period. This strategy ensures that each sample is representative of the in scope Canadian population aged 12 to 17 years old for each three-month period.  5.6 Sampling of interviewees  Since the sample for the youth population is selected from a list of individuals, the selection of the interviewee is automatically handled at sampling and no extra step is required at collection. The selection of an interviewee at collection is now only required for the adult population. The selection strategy that was adopted accounted for user needs, cost, design efficiency, response burden and operational constraints. For a household selected as part of the 18+ sample, one person is selected per household using varying probabilities taking into account the age and the household composition. The selection probabilities resulted from simulations using various parameters in order to determine the optimal approach without causing extreme sampling weights. Table 5.3 gives the selection weight multiplicative factors used to determine the probabilities of selection of individuals in sampled households by age group. For example, for a three-person household formed of two people between the ages of 35 and 64 and one 19-year-old, the 19-yearold would have a 1/2 chance of being selected (i.e., 20/(20+10+10)) while each of the 35 to 64 year olds would have a 1/4 chance of being selected. To avoid extreme sampling weights, there is one exception to this rule: if the size of the household is greater than or equal to five or if the number of 18-19 year olds is greater than or equal to three then the selection weight multiplicative 8In Yukon, after the 2016 Census of Population, the coverage was expanded to represent 94% of the targeted population. Before it was 92%. 9 In Nunavut, after the 2016 Census of Population, the coverage was expanded to represent 93% of the targeted population. Before it was 92%. 13 factor equals 1 for each individual in the household. Consequently, all people in that household have the same probability of being selected.

The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) employs a multi-stage sampling design to select its sample, ensuring coverage of the Canadian population aged 12 and over, with certain exclusions such as those living on reserves, full-time Canadian Forces members, and institutionalized individuals. For the adult population (18+), the sampling is based on an area frame, where primary sampling units (PSUs) are selected from geographic clusters, and dwellings within these clusters are sampled using systematic methods. For the youth population (12-17), a list frame derived from the Canadian Child Benefit (CCB) files is used to directly select respondents. The total sample size consists of approximately 130,000 individuals, with around 120,000 allocated to adults and 10,000 to youth. The sample is further stratified by health region (HR), and the allocation ensures that each HR has a minimum of 500 respondents. In the provinces, the sample is allocated using a 0.75 power allocation based on population size, while in the territories, the allocation allows for representativeness over a two-year period. The data collection is spread across four 3-month periods to balance interviewer workload and minimize seasonal biases. Additionally, the CCHS incorporates selection probabilities within households to determine which individual is chosen for the survey, with adjustments made to avoid extreme sampling weights in larger households.

Sampling Frame:
The sampling frame for the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) consists of two distinct components based on the target population. For the adult population (18 years and older), the sampling frame is derived from an area frame used by the Canadian Labour Force Survey (LFS). This area frame includes all primary sampling units (PSUs), which are geographic clusters of dwellings within health regions across Canada. For the youth population (12 to 17 years old), the sampling frame is based on a list derived from the Canadian Child Benefit (CCB) files, which includes a list of all program beneficiaries with their names, addresses, and phone numbers.

Sample:
The sample for the CCHS is drawn from the respective sampling frames for adults and youth. Approximately 130,000 individuals are selected for the survey, with around 120,000 respondents allocated to the adult population and 10,000 to the youth population. The sample is stratified by health region, ensuring that each health region has a minimum of 500 respondents. The sample for adults is selected from the area frame using a multi-stage sampling process, while the youth sample is directly selected from the CCB list. The allocation for provinces and territories is based on population size, with a focus on achieving representativeness within each health region.

DATA COLLECTION 6.1 Computer-assisted interviewing  20 The CCHS uses two separate CAI applications to collect data, one for telephone interviews (CATI) and one for personal interviews (CAPI). This was done in order to customise each application’s functionality to the type of interview being conducted. Each application consisted of an entry component, a health content, and an exit component.  Between January and December 2018, approximately 54,100 valid interviews were conducted using CAI. Approximately 25% of these completed cases were conducted in person using CAPI, and the other 75% were conducted over the phone using CATI. CAI offers two main advantages over other collection methods. First, CAI offers a case management system and data transmission functionality. This case management system automatically records important management information for each attempt on a case and provides reports for the management of the collection process. CAI also provides an automated call scheduler, i.e. a central system to optimise the timing of call-backs and the scheduling of appointments used to support CATI collection.  The case management system routes the questionnaire applications and sample files from Statistics Canada’s main office to regional collection offices (in the case of CATI) and from the regional offices to the interviewers laptops (for CAPI). Data returning to the main office takes the reverse route. To ensure confidentiality, the data is encrypted before transmission. The data are then decrypted when they are on a separate secure computer with no remote access.  Second, CAI allows for custom interviews for every respondent based on their individual characteristics and survey responses. This includes:  questions that are not applicable to the respondent are skipped automatically   edits to check for inconsistent answers or out-of-range responses are applied automatically and on-screen prompts are shown when an invalid entry is recorded. Immediate feedback is given to the respondent and the interviewer is able to correct any inconsistencies. 14  question text, including reference periods and pronouns, is customised automatically based on factors such as the age and sex of the respondent, the date of the interview and answers to previous questions.  6.2 CCHS application development  Entry and exit components were developed for CATI and CAPI interviewing. These components contain standard sets of questions designed to guide the interviewer through contact initiation, collection of important sample information, respondent selection and determination of cases status. The health content consists of the health modules themselves and made up the bulk of the applications. This includes common modules asked of all respondents and optional modules which differed by provinces and territories. Each application underwent three stages of testing: block, integrated and end to end.  Block level testing consists of independently testing each content module or “block” to ensure skip patterns, logic flows and text, in both official languages, are specified correctly. Skip patterns or logic flows across modules are not tested at this stage as each module is treated as a standalone questionnaire. Once all blocks are verified by several testers, they are added together along with entry and exit components into integrated applications. These newly integrated applications are then ready for the next stage of testing. Integrated testing occurs when all of the tested modules are added together, along with the entry and exit components, into an integrated application. This second stage of testing ensures that key demographic information such as age, sex, and economic family status are passed from the entry to the health content and exit components of the applications. It also ensures that variables affecting skip patterns and logic flows are correctly passed between modules within the health content. Since, at this stage the applications essentially function as they will in the field, all possible scenarios faced by interviewers are simulated to ensure proper functionality. These scenarios test various aspects of the entry and exit components including, establishing contact, collecting contact information, determining whether a case is in scope, rostering households, creating appointments and selecting respondents. The applications are also tested to ensure that during an interview, correct modules are triggered reflecting optional content selections.  End-to-end testing occurs when the fully integrated applications are placed in a simulated collection environment. The applications are loaded onto computers that are connected to a test server. Data is then collected, transmitted and extracted in real time, exactly as it would be done in the field. This last stage of testing allows for the testing of all technical aspects of data input, transmission and extraction for each of the CCHS applications. It also provided a final chance of finding errors within the entry, health content and exit components. 6.3 Interviewer training Project managers, senior interviewers and interviewers from regional collection offices were sent self-study training packages before the start of collection. These packages were prepared by the CCHS project team and were used by existing experienced CCHS interviewers to reinforce their 15 previous training. Project managers and senior interviewers also conducted customised training sessions for new CCHS interviewing staff as needed. There were also specific training sessions to deal with various topics related to CCHS collection on a monthly basis. The focus of the training sessions were to get interviewers comfortable using the CCHS 2018 applications, and familiarise interviewers with survey content and to introduce interviewers to interviewing procedures specific to the CCHS. The training focused on:  goals and objectives of the survey including a focus on the survey redesign  survey methodology  application functionality  review of the questionnaire content and exercises with an emphasis on significant content changes  interviewer techniques for maintaining response - complete exercises to minimise nonresponse   use of mock interviews to simulate difficult situations and practise potential non-response situations   survey management  transmission procedures One of the key aspects of the training was a focus on minimizing non-response. Exercises to minimise non-response were prepared for interviewers. The purpose of these exercises was to have the interviewers practice convincing reluctant respondents to participate in the survey. There was also a series of refusal avoidance workshops given to the senior interviewers responsible for refusal conversion in each regional collection office.  6.4 The interview Sample units were selected from an area frame for the population aged 18 and older, and the Canadian Child Benefit (CCB) frame for the population aged 12 to 17. Approximately 75% of the respondents selected from the area frame and all of the respondents selected from the CCB frames were interviewed from centralised call centres using CATI. The CATI interviewers were supervised by a senior interviewer located in the same call centre. About 25% of the area frame respondents were interviewed by decentralised field interviewers using CAPI. While in some situations field interviewers were permitted to complete some or part of an interview by telephone, roughly three quarters of these interviews were conducted exclusively in person. CAPI interviewers worked independently from their homes using laptop computers and were supervised from a distance by senior interviewers. The variable CASETYPE on the microdata file indicates which frame a case was selected from, as well as the collection mode it was completed in. The following shows the breakdown of CASETYPE: 16 - CASETYPE = 0: case was selected from area frame and completed in CAPI - - CASETYPE = 1: case was selected from CCB frame (12-17 years old) and completed in CATI CASETYPE = 2: case was selected from area frame and completed in CATI CAPI interviewers were trained to make an initial personal contact with each sampled dwelling. In cases where this initial visit resulted in non-response, telephone follow-ups were permitted. The variable ADM_N040 on the microdata files indicates whether the CAPI interview (CASETYPE=0) was completed face-to-face, by telephone or using a combination of the two techniques. In all selected dwellings, a knowledgeable household member was asked to supply basic demographic information on all residents of the dwelling. One member of the household was then selected for a more in-depth interview, which is referred to as the health content interview.  To ensure the quality of the data collected, interviewers were instructed to make every effort to conduct the interview with the selected respondent in privacy. In situations where this was unavoidable, the respondent was interviewed with another person present. Flags on the microdata files indicate whether somebody other than the respondent was present during the interview (ADM_N045) and whether the interviewer felt that the respondent’s answers were influenced by the presence of the other person (ADM_N050). To ensure the best possible response rate attainable, many practices were used to minimise nonresponse, including: a) Introductory letters Before the start of each collection period, introductory letters and brochures explaining the purpose of the survey were sent to the sampled households. These explained the importance of the survey and provided examples of how CCHS data would be used.  b) Initiating contact  Interviewers were instructed to make all reasonable attempts to obtain interviews. When the timing of the interviewer's call (or visit) was inconvenient, an appointment was made to call back at a more convenient time. If requests for appointments were unsuccessful over the telephone, interviewers were instructed to follow-up with a personal visit. If no one was home on first visit, a brochure with information about the survey and intention to make contact was left at the door. Numerous call-backs were made at different times on different days.  c) Refusal conversion For individuals who at first refused to participate in the survey, a letter was sent from the nearest Statistics Canada Regional Office to the respondent, stressing the importance of the survey and the household's collaboration. This was followed by a second call (or visit) from a senior 17 interviewer, a project supervisor or another interviewer to try to convince respondent of the importance of participating in the survey.  d) Language barriers To remove language as a barrier to conducting interviews, each of the Statistics Canada Regional Offices recruited interviewers with a wide range of language competencies. When necessary, cases were transferred to an interviewer with the language competency needed to complete an interview.  e) Youth interviews In 2018, interviewers needed to obtain verbal permission from parents/guardians to interview youths between the ages of 12 to 14 who were selected for interviews. This information was collected in the Parental/Guardian Consent (PGC) block in the survey entry component. Several procedures were followed by interviewers to alleviate potential parental concerns and to ensure a completed interview.  If a parent/guardian asked to see the actual questions; interviewers were instructed to immediately have the regional office send a copy of the questionnaire.  If privacy could not be obtained to interview the selected youth over the phone (another person listening in) the interview was coded a refusal.  The Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) block collected household level information found at the end of the survey (Insurance coverage, Food Security, Income and Administration) from the most knowledgeable person in the household. In 2018, this block is initiated when the selected respondent is between the ages of 12 to 17. The block formalizes the process of identifying a person in the household who is likely better able to answer these household level questions than the young selected respondent. If a PMK is found, then the interview moves from the younger selected respondent between the ages of 12 and 17, to a household member who finishes the rest of the interview after the PMK block.  f) Proxy interviews In cases where the selected respondent was, for reasons of physical or mental health, incapable of completing an interview, another knowledgeable member of the household supplied information about the selected respondent. This is known as a proxy interview. While proxy interviewees were able to provide accurate answers to most of the survey questions, the more sensitive or personal questions were beyond the scope of knowledge of a proxy respondent. This resulted in some questions from the proxy interview being unanswered. Every effort was taken to keep proxy interviews to a minimum. Since 2010, the Proxy interview (GR) block has been modified to prompt the interviewer to specifically identify whether the proxy interview is being conducted due to a physical or mental condition. Interviewers are then asked to record the specific condition for either case. The variable ADM_PRX indicates whether a case was completed by proxy. 18 6.5 Field operations The 2018 sample was divided into 4 non-overlapping three-month collection periods. Regional collection offices were instructed to use the first 4 weeks of each collection period to resolve the majority of the sample, with next 8 weeks being used finalise the remaining sample and to follow up on outstanding non-response cases. All CATI cases were to have been attempted by the second week of each collection period. Sample files were sent approximately two weeks before the start of each collection period to centralised collection offices. A series of dummy cases were included with each CAPI sample. These cases were completed by senior interviewers for the purposes of ensuring that all data transmission procedures were working through the collection cycle. Once the samples were received, project supervisors were responsible for planning CAPI interviewer assignments. Wherever possible, assignments were generally no larger than 15 cases per interviewer.  Transmission of cases from each of the CATI offices to head office was the responsibility of the regional office project supervisor, senior interviewer and the technical support team. These transmissions were performed nightly and sent all completed cases to Statistics Canada’s head office. Completed CAPI interviews were transmitted daily from the interviewer’s home directly to Statistics Canada’s head office using a secure telephone transmission. For final response rates, refer to Appendix E.  6.6 Quality control and collection management During the collection year, several methods are used to ensure data quality and to optimize collection. These included using internal measures to verify interviewer performance and the use of a series of ongoing reports to monitor various collection targets and data quality. A system of validation was used for CAPI cases whereby interviewers had their work validated on a regular basis by the Regional Office. Each collection period, randomly selected cases were flagged in the sample. Regional office managers and supervisors created lists of cases to be validated. These cases were handed to the validation team who then contacted households to verify that a legitimate interview took place. Validation procedures generally occurred during the first few weeks of a collection period to ensure that any issues were detected promptly. Interviewers were provided feedback by their supervisors on a regular basis.  Since 2011, an additional quality control system was introduced for CAPI interviews. Upon obtaining consent from the respondents, specific sections of the CAPI interviews were recorded. These recordings were transmitted back to the regional offices, and then randomly chosen for analysis. CATI interviewers were also randomly chosen for validation. Validation in the CATI collection offices consisted of senior interviewers monitoring interviews to ensure proper techniques and procedures (reading the questions as worded in the applications, not prompting respondents for answers, etc.) were followed by the interviewer.  A series of reports were produced to effectively track and manage collection targets and to assist in identifying other collection issues.  19 Cumulative reports were generated at the end of each collection period, showing response, link, share and proxy rates for both the CATI and CAPI samples by individual health region. The reports were useful in identifying health regions that were below collection target levels, allowing the regional offices to focus efforts in these regions.  Using information obtained from the CAI applications, further analysis was done in head office in order to identify interviews that were completed below acceptable time frames. These short interviews were flagged, removed from the microdata and treated as non-response.  In 2014, a new collection management approach was implemented to improve the efficiency of the CATI data collection: Responsive Collection Design. Responsive Collection Design (RCD) is a new collection strategy that allows the Regional Offices (ROs) to adjust data collection approaches throughout the collection period. In basic terms, it allows the ROs to group cases according to a number of factors, and then target the groups that we are interested in. In an ordinary CATI survey, the interviewer groups remain constant throughout collection. However, during Responsive Collection Design, these groups change during each phase of collection in order to maximize response rates, productivity and the representativeness of the collected sample. With the 2015 CCHS redesign, a dynamic telephone number strategy was developed. Starting in 2015, the 18+ years old sample can have up to 2 phone numbers, while the CCB samples can have up to 4 telephone numbers. This increases the number of available telephone numbers CATI interviewers can call to maximize their potential ability to reach the selected households or respondents. In addition, the functionality of transferring CATI (telephone) area frame cases to CAPI field interviewers was added. For cases that were contacted in CATI and reached the wrong address, had the wrong telephone number, or could not be reached, these cases would be transferred to the field CAPI interviewers who would then physically visit the listed address to try and collect a response. This ensures that all cases will have sufficient contact attempts.

Report on Sample Recruitment for the 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)

1. Overview of the Sampling Approach

The 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) utilized a complex sampling approach designed to ensure that the sample was representative of the Canadian population, with a focus on different age groups and regions. The survey recruited participants from two primary sampling frames: the area frame, which covered the general population aged 18 and older, and the Canadian Child Benefit (CCB) frame, which included individuals aged 12 to 17.

2. Selection of the Sample

To recruit participants, a two-stage sampling process was employed. First, a sample of dwellings was selected from the area frame and the CCB frame. Approximately 75% of the respondents selected from the area frame were interviewed using the centralized Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) method, while all respondents selected from the CCB frame were interviewed using CATI as well. A smaller portion of respondents, about 25% from the area frame, were selected for interviews through decentralized Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI).

The selection of the sample was based on these frames, and the variable CASETYPE was used in the microdata file to indicate which frame a case was selected from and the mode of data collection (CAPI or CATI). For instance, CASETYPE = 0 refers to cases selected from the area frame and completed using CAPI, while CASETYPE = 2 refers to those selected from the area frame and completed using CATI.

3. Interviewer Training and Preparation

To ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the data collection, all interviewers underwent a comprehensive training program. The training included an introduction to the CCHS 2018 applications, survey content, and interviewing techniques. Specific sessions focused on reducing non-response rates and handling situations where respondents were reluctant to participate. Interviewers were also trained to use the CAI system effectively, which provided automated features such as scheduling and ensuring that skip patterns and logic flows were properly followed.

Data collection for the 2018 CCHS involved two primary methods: CATI and CAPI. CATI was used for the majority of the interviews (around 75%) and was conducted from centralized call centers, where interviewers contacted respondents by phone. CAPI was used for the remaining 25% of respondents, with interviewers visiting respondents in person. In cases where a respondent could not be reached or preferred not to respond by phone, the case was transferred to CAPI interviewers for an in-person visit. The variable ADM_N040 in the microdata indicates whether the CAPI interview was completed face-to-face, by telephone, or using a combination of both methods.

5. Ensuring a High Response Rate

To maximize response rates, several strategies were employed. Before interviews began, introductory letters and brochures explaining the purpose of the survey were sent to selected households. This communication emphasized the importance of the survey and informed households about the potential uses of the data. Interviewers were instructed to make multiple attempts to contact selected households, and if initial contact attempts failed, they would follow up with a personal visit.

For those who initially refused to participate, refusal conversion procedures were implemented. Senior interviewers or project supervisors made additional calls or visits to convince the household of the importance of their participation. Additionally, language barriers were addressed by recruiting interviewers with a wide range of language competencies.

6. Special Considerations for Youth and Proxy Interviews

Specific procedures were put in place for interviewing youths aged 12 to 14. Parental or guardian consent was required before interviewing individuals in this age group. For youths aged 12 to 17, the Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) block was used to collect household-level information when the selected respondent was not able to answer questions about their household. Additionally, in cases where the selected respondent could not participate due to physical or mental health issues, a proxy interview was conducted, with another knowledgeable household member providing responses.

7. Quality Control Measures

Throughout the data collection process, rigorous quality control measures were implemented to ensure data accuracy. CAPI interviews were subject to validation procedures, where randomly selected cases were verified to ensure the legitimacy of the interviews. Additionally, some sections of CAPI interviews were recorded and reviewed for quality assurance. CATI interviews also underwent regular monitoring by senior interviewers to ensure compliance with the interview protocol. Cumulative reports generated at the end of each collection period helped identify areas where the response rate was low and allowed for targeted follow-up in specific regions.

8. Conclusion

The 2018 CCHS employed a detailed and structured recruitment and data collection process to ensure that a diverse, representative sample of Canadians was included. Through a combination of telephone and in-person interviews, along with multiple strategies to address non-response and ensure data quality, the CCHS was able to gather reliable health-related data from households across Canada. The careful planning and execution of the sampling process, along with continuous quality control, contributed to the overall success of the survey.

ChatGPT
Here’s a detailed report on how the sample for the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2018 was recruited:

Sample Recruitment for the 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)
The sample for the 2018 CCHS was recruited through a multi-stage, stratified process designed to obtain a representative sample of the Canadian population, aged 12 years and older. The sampling process was divided into two main categories based on the target age groups: individuals aged 18 and older and youths aged 12 to 17.

1. Selection of Sample Units
The sample was drawn from two distinct frames:

Area Frame: This frame was used to select households for respondents aged 18 and older. The area frame covers the entire Canadian population and is designed to represent geographic areas across the country.
Canadian Child Benefit (CCB) Frame: This frame was used to select households with youths aged 12 to 17. The CCB frame was specifically used to identify youth in households receiving the Canadian Child Benefit.
2. Data Collection Modes
The data collection for the CCHS was carried out using two primary methods:

Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI): This method was used for approximately 75% of respondents selected from the area frame and for all respondents selected from the CCB frame (aged 12-17). Interviews were conducted over the phone by trained interviewers in centralized call centers.
Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI): This method was used for about 25% of the area frame respondents. These interviews were conducted face-to-face by decentralized field interviewers using laptops. Interviewers primarily visited households in person, though telephone follow-ups were permitted if necessary.
3. Stratified Sampling and Interviewer Assignments
The sampling process was designed to maximize coverage and minimize non-response. Each regional office of Statistics Canada was responsible for assigning cases to interviewers, with careful consideration of the geographic and demographic distribution of respondents.

Stratification: The sample was stratified by region to ensure representation from each geographic area.
Assignment of Interviewers: Interviewers were assigned cases based on their regional collection office, and the assignments typically included no more than 15 cases per interviewer to ensure manageable workloads. These assignments were planned to be completed in four non-overlapping three-month collection periods, with different phases for initial and follow-up attempts.
4. Interview Scheduling and Contact Attempts
To optimize the contact process, the recruitment followed several steps:

Initial Contact: Interviewers initiated contact with the selected households by either telephone or personal visit, depending on the sampling frame and mode of data collection.
Follow-up Attempts: If initial contact was unsuccessful, additional efforts were made to reach the household through scheduled callbacks, including multiple attempts at different times and days. If necessary, personal visits were conducted to obtain the interview.
5. Special Procedures for Youth Interviews
For youths aged 12-17 selected for interviews:

Parental/Guardian Consent: Interviewers were required to obtain verbal consent from a parent or guardian before interviewing youths aged 12-14. If a parent or guardian requested to see the questionnaire, they were provided with a copy before the interview.
Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK): In cases where the selected youth was unable to complete the interview, a "Person Most Knowledgeable" (PMK) within the household was interviewed instead. This procedure ensured that household-level information was collected even if the selected youth was unable to provide it.
6. Managing Non-Response
To minimize non-response and maximize participation:

Introductory Letters: Prior to the start of data collection, sampled households received introductory letters and brochures outlining the purpose of the survey and its importance. This helped inform the respondents about the survey and encourage participation.
Refusal Conversion: If respondents initially refused to participate, they were contacted again by a senior interviewer, emphasizing the importance of the survey. In some cases, letters from Statistics Canada were sent to encourage participation.
Language Barriers: For respondents who spoke languages other than those available through the interviewers, the regional offices made arrangements to recruit bilingual interviewers or transfer the case to an interviewer with the necessary language skills.
7. Proxy Interviews
If the selected respondent was unable to participate due to physical or mental health conditions, a proxy interview was conducted. A knowledgeable household member would provide information on behalf of the selected respondent. However, the more personal and sensitive questions were omitted from these interviews, as the proxy could not reliably answer them.

8. Quality Control and Monitoring
Throughout the recruitment process, several quality control measures were in place to ensure the accuracy and validity of the data:

Validation Procedures: A random selection of interviews was validated to ensure the integrity of the data. These validations involved contacting households to confirm that the interview took place and checking the quality of the responses.
Monitoring of Response Rates: Cumulative reports were generated at the end of each collection period, showing response rates by region, to help regional offices identify areas that required additional follow-up.
Recording of Interviews: Specific sections of CAPI interviews were recorded for quality control purposes and analyzed to ensure proper procedures were followed by interviewers.
This detailed approach to sample recruitment, through stratified sampling, multiple contact attempts, specialized procedures for youth interviews, and rigorous quality control measures, ensured that the CCHS 2018 collected a representative and high-quality dataset.

A6 – Household Nonresponse During collection, a certain proportion of sampled households inevitably result in nonresponse. 10 Statistics Canada, 2017. Guide to the Labour Force Survey, Statistics Canada. Cat. No. 71-543-G. 25 This usually occurs when a household refuses to participate in the survey, provides unusable data, or cannot be reached for an interview. Weights of the nonresponding households are redistributed to responding households within response homogeneity groups (RHGs), which are formed within province. In order to create the response homogeneity groups, a scoring method based on logistic regression models is used to determine the propensity to respond and these response probabilities are used to divide the sample into groups with similar response properties. The information available for nonrespondents is limited so the regression models use characteristics such as the collection period, geographic information and variables from Statistics Canada’s Household Survey Frame, as well as paradata or process data, which includes the number of contact attempts, the time/day of attempt, and whether the household was called on a weekend or weekday. Separate models are created for dwellings that were contacted by telephone and for dwellings that were contacted in-person. An adjustment factor is calculated within each response homogeneity group as follows: 𝑆𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠 𝐴5 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑙 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑠 𝑆𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠 𝐴5 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑠 Weight A5 is multiplied by this adjustment factor to produce weight A6 for the responding households. Non-responding households are dropped from the process at this point. 

A9 – Person-level Nonresponse A CCHS interview for area frame dwellings can be seen as a two-part process. First, the interviewer gets the complete roster of the people within the household. Second, the selected person is interviewed. In some cases, interviewers can only get through the first part, either because they cannot get in touch with the selected person, or because that selected person refuses to be interviewed. Such individuals are defined as person nonrespondents and an adjustment factor must be applied to the weights of person respondents to account for this nonresponse. Using the same methodology that is used in the treatment of household nonresponse, the adjustment is applied within response homogeneity groups. In this process, the scoring method is used to define a response probability based on characteristics available for both respondents and non-respondents. All characteristics collected when creating the roster of household members are available for the estimation of the response probabilities as well as geographic information and some paradata. The probabilities are grouped into response homogeneity groups and the following adjustment factor is calculated within each group: 26 𝑆𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠 𝐴8 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑆𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠 𝐴8 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑠 Weight A8 for responding persons is multiplied by the above adjustment factor to produce weight A9. Nonresponding persons are dropped from the weighting process from this point onward. 

From the data above, i want you to tell us how CCHS data handled non response
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) employs a multi-step process to handle nonresponse at both the household and person levels. Here's a breakdown of how nonresponse is addressed:

1. Household Nonresponse (A6)
When a sampled household does not respond to the survey, whether due to refusal, inability to reach them, or providing unusable data, the nonresponse is addressed using the following methodology:

Response Homogeneity Groups (RHGs): Households are grouped into response homogeneity groups based on their similarities in response propensity. This grouping helps ensure that nonresponse adjustments are made appropriately by considering how likely different households are to respond, based on factors like geographic location, collection period, and other available characteristics.

Logistic Regression Models: A logistic regression model is used to predict the likelihood of a household responding. The model incorporates several characteristics to determine this likelihood, including:

Collection period: The time frame when the survey is being conducted.
Geographic information: The location of the household.
Process data (paradata): Data like the number of contact attempts, the time and day of attempts, and whether the household was contacted on a weekday or weekend.
Adjustment Factor Calculation: An adjustment factor is calculated based on the predicted response probabilities within each RHG. This adjustment factor is used to re-weight the responses, ensuring that the weights for responding households are appropriately adjusted.

Weight Redistribution: The weight for responding households (Weight A5) is multiplied by this adjustment factor to produce a new weight (Weight A6). Nonresponding households are dropped from the process at this stage.

2. Person-Level Nonresponse (A9)
In the CCHS, a two-part process occurs during data collection:

The interviewer first collects the household roster (list of people within the household).
The selected individual from the roster is then interviewed.
Sometimes, interviewers cannot contact the selected person, or the person refuses to participate. These cases are handled as person-level nonresponse:

Adjustment for Person Nonresponse: Just like with household nonresponse, an adjustment is applied to the weights of the responding individuals to account for those who did not respond.

Response Probability Calculation: Using the same approach as for household nonresponse, a logistic regression model is used to calculate the likelihood (probability) that a selected person will respond to the interview. This model includes:

Characteristics from the household roster.
Geographic information.
Paradata (such as contact attempts and response history).
Grouping and Weight Adjustment: The selected persons are grouped into response homogeneity groups (RHGs) based

Handling Nonresponse in the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)
The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) employs a systematic approach to address nonresponse at both the household and person levels. This ensures that the survey results remain representative of the general population, even when certain individuals or households do not respond. The nonresponse handling methodology is as follows:

1. Household Nonresponse (A6)
Nonresponse at the household level occurs when a sampled household either refuses to participate, is unreachable, or provides unusable data. To address this, CCHS uses the following process:

Response Homogeneity Groups (RHGs): To adjust for nonresponse, the survey sample is divided into response homogeneity groups (RHGs), which group households based on their likelihood of responding. This helps ensure that the adjustment for nonresponse is made based on similar response propensities.

Logistic Regression Models: A logistic regression model is used to predict the likelihood of a household responding to the survey. The model incorporates several factors, including:

Collection Period: The timing of the survey (e.g., seasonal differences).
Geographic Information: The location of the household (e.g., urban vs. rural).
Process Data (Paradata): Information on the number of contact attempts, timing of attempts (e.g., weekday vs. weekend), and whether the household was contacted in person or by phone.
Adjustment Factor Calculation: Based on the predicted response probabilities, an adjustment factor is computed within each RHG. This factor helps correct for nonresponse by redistributing the weight of nonresponding households to those that did respond.

Weight Redistribution: The final adjustment is made by multiplying the weight of responding households (Weight A5) by the adjustment factor, resulting in a new weight (Weight A6). Nonresponding households are excluded from the weighting process after this adjustment.

2. Person-Level Nonresponse (A9)
The CCHS interview process is divided into two parts:

The interviewer first collects a complete roster of household members.
A selected individual from the roster is then interviewed.
In cases where the selected individual cannot be contacted or refuses to participate, person-level nonresponse occurs. The handling of this nonresponse is as follows:

Adjustment for Person Nonresponse: Similar to household nonresponse, an adjustment is applied to the weights of responding individuals to account for those who did not respond. This ensures that the survey remains representative of the entire population.

Response Probability Calculation: A logistic regression model is applied to estimate the likelihood that a selected individual will respond to the survey. This model uses:

Household Roster Characteristics: Information gathered during the first part of the interview (e.g., age, sex, etc.).
Geographic Information: The location of the household.
Paradata: Information about the contact process, including the number of attempts and when the person was contacted.
Grouping and Weight Adjustment: The selected individuals are grouped into response homogeneity groups (RHGs) based on their calculated response probabilities. Within each RHG, an adjustment factor is calculated to correct for person-level nonresponse:

Adjustment Factor
=
∑
Weights for All Selected Persons
∑
Weights for Responding Selected Persons
Adjustment Factor= 
∑Weights for Responding Selected Persons
∑Weights for All Selected Persons
​
 
Weight Redistribution: The weight for responding individuals (Weight A8) is multiplied by this adjustment factor to produce the final weight (Weight A9). Nonresponding individuals are removed from the weighting process at this point.

Conclusion
The handling of nonresponse in the CCHS is a robust process that ensures the accuracy and representativeness of the survey data. By using response homogeneity groups, logistic regression models, and weight adjustments at both the household and person levels, the CCHS effectively mitigates the impact of nonresponse on survey results. These methods allow for more reliable and generalizable estimates, reflecting the characteristics of the population as a whole.

Impact of Nonresponse Handling on the Final Dataset of the CCHS
The nonresponse handling procedures employed by the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) are critical for maintaining the quality, representativeness, and accuracy of the final dataset. These methods help correct for biases introduced by households or individuals who either refuse to participate or are unreachable, but the way they are implemented can have both positive and negative consequences on the dataset.

Positive Aspects of Nonresponse Handling
Improved Representativeness
The most significant advantage of the CCHS nonresponse handling is the creation of response homogeneity groups (RHGs). By grouping households or individuals with similar response probabilities, the survey ensures that the final dataset remains representative of the broader population. This stratified approach helps to minimize the bias that would otherwise result from over- or under-representing certain groups based on their likelihood of responding. For example, if certain demographic groups (e.g., older adults or individuals from rural areas) are less likely to respond, the redistribution of weights ensures their underrepresentation is corrected.

Use of Logistic Regression Models
The use of logistic regression to model response probabilities is another strength of this approach. These models incorporate multiple factors, including geographic location, collection period, and paradata, providing a comprehensive way of estimating the likelihood of nonresponse. This allows for more accurate adjustments than simpler methods and ensures that adjustments are tailored to the characteristics of each household or individual, rather than assuming a uniform nonresponse pattern across all respondents.

Enhanced Data Accuracy
The weighting process applied to both household (A6) and person-level (A9) nonresponse helps adjust the final dataset in such a way that it minimizes bias and provides a more accurate reflection of the population. For example, if a particular region or demographic group is underrepresented due to nonresponse, the adjustment factor ensures that the final dataset accounts for this discrepancy, making the results more reliable for policy-making, health research, and other applications.

Paradata Inclusion
By incorporating paradata, such as the number of contact attempts and the timing of those attempts, CCHS is able to use rich process data to improve its adjustment models. This is a sophisticated way of accounting for the difficulties encountered during the data collection process, further enhancing the quality of the final dataset.

Negative Aspects of Nonresponse Handling
Potential for Residual Bias
Despite the efforts to correct for nonresponse, the reliance on response homogeneity groups and logistic regression models does not completely eliminate all biases. Some nonrespondents may share characteristics that are difficult to model accurately, such as deeply ingrained social or economic factors. In cases where the model cannot fully capture these differences, residual bias can remain in the final dataset. For instance, if certain hard-to-reach populations are still underrepresented despite the adjustments, it may lead to skewed estimates that are not fully reflective of these groups' health status or behaviors.

Complexity and Data Quality Issues
The process of creating response homogeneity groups and calculating complex adjustment factors requires extensive data processing and modeling. This increases the potential for errors in the adjustment process, especially if the data inputs are not accurate or if the models used to estimate response probabilities are not well-calibrated. Additionally, the reliance on paradata, which may not always be complete or consistent, could introduce uncertainties that affect the final weights and ultimately the accuracy of the dataset.

Exclusion of Nonrespondents
Nonresponding households and individuals are completely excluded from the final weighting process, which means that any information they could have contributed is not considered in the final analysis. While this exclusion helps ensure that the dataset reflects only the responses of those who participated, it also means that certain populations are not represented in the data at all. This could be particularly problematic for understanding the health and socio-economic characteristics of marginalized or vulnerable groups who may be more likely to refuse participation or be difficult to contact.

Over-Reliance on Statistical Adjustments
The heavy reliance on statistical adjustments, such as logistic regression, to account for nonresponse could obscure some of the limitations of the data. If the models used to predict response probabilities are not perfectly accurate, the adjustments may not fully account for nonresponse bias. Moreover, these adjustments assume that the patterns of nonresponse are relatively stable across different subgroups, which may not always be the case in practice.

Conclusion
The nonresponse handling procedures in the CCHS are well-designed to address the issue of nonresponse and mitigate potential biases in the dataset. The use of response homogeneity groups, logistic regression models, and weighting adjustments provides a strong methodological foundation for ensuring that the final dataset is representative and accurate. However, these methods are not without their limitations. Despite the adjustments, residual bias may persist, particularly if certain hard-to-reach groups remain underrepresented. Additionally, the complexity of the process and the exclusion of nonrespondents from the final weighting can introduce challenges that may affect the quality of the dataset. Overall, while the nonresponse handling is a strength of the CCHS, it is important to acknowledge these potential weaknesses when interpreting the results and drawing conclusions from the data.

Types of Bias in CCHS Nonresponse Handling and Their Impact on the Final Dataset
The nonresponse handling procedures in the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) are designed to correct for biases that arise from households or individuals who do not respond. However, these methods do not eliminate all potential biases, and some specific types of bias may still influence the final dataset. Below, we specify the types of biases that are particularly relevant to the CCHS nonresponse handling process:

1. Selection Bias
Selection bias occurs when the sample is not representative of the target population due to the way participants are selected or excluded. In the context of CCHS nonresponse handling:

Nonresponse bias: Although CCHS applies weighting adjustments to correct for nonresponse, there is still a risk that certain households or individuals are more likely to refuse participation or be unreachable. These groups may have different characteristics (e.g., socio-economic status, health behaviors) than those who respond, resulting in selection bias. For example, individuals from lower-income households or certain ethnic minorities may be less likely to respond, and if their characteristics are not adequately accounted for in the weighting process, the final dataset could misrepresent these groups.

Bias from exclusion of nonrespondents: When nonresponding households are excluded from the weighting process, it may lead to underrepresentation of certain subgroups, such as people with health issues, younger individuals, or those living in rural areas. This could further skew the sample, particularly if nonrespondents have distinct health behaviors or other relevant characteristics.

2. Response Bias
Response bias occurs when individuals give inaccurate or untruthful answers, either intentionally or unintentionally. CCHS attempts to mitigate this through robust data collection methods, but it remains a potential source of bias:

Social desirability bias: In health surveys like the CCHS, respondents may over-report positive behaviors (e.g., physical activity) and under-report negative ones (e.g., alcohol consumption or smoking) to align with social expectations. This is a common form of response bias and can skew the findings on health behaviors in the final dataset.

Recall bias: Respondents may have difficulty recalling information accurately, such as details about past health conditions or behavior patterns. This can introduce errors in the dataset, especially if recall accuracy varies between different groups in the population (e.g., older adults may have more difficulty remembering past events).

3. Measurement Bias
Measurement bias arises when the tools or methods used to collect data are flawed or inaccurate, leading to systematic errors in measurement. Although CCHS uses standardized and validated instruments to collect data, the possibility of measurement bias still exists:

Instrumental bias: If the survey instruments used in CCHS, such as questionnaires or interview methods, are poorly designed or not adequately tailored for certain populations (e.g., certain age groups or ethnic communities), they may produce biased responses.

Interviewer bias: Interviewers themselves can inadvertently influence responses through their behavior, tone, or approach. This is particularly relevant in surveys where in-person interviews are conducted. Interviewers may, consciously or unconsciously, steer respondents towards certain answers, thus introducing bias into the dataset.

4. Nonresponse Bias
Nonresponse bias specifically arises when the data from nonrespondents are not accounted for, leading to a distortion of the dataset. CCHS attempts to adjust for this with the use of response homogeneity groups (RHGs) and logistic regression models, but some forms of nonresponse bias may still persist:

Under-coverage bias: If certain populations (e.g., homeless individuals or transient groups) are more likely to refuse or be unavailable for the survey, they are underrepresented in the final dataset. These populations may exhibit different health patterns, leading to under-coverage bias in estimates of overall health.

Exclusion bias: The exclusion of nonrespondents from the process can lead to bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics that differ significantly from those of the respondents. For example, if individuals in low-income or immigrant households are more likely to refuse participation, the final dataset might not fully capture the health status or behaviors of these groups, leading to inaccurate conclusions about the health of the general population.

5. Racial or Ethnic Bias
Racial or ethnic bias refers to disparities in response rates and measurement accuracy across different racial or ethnic groups. CCHS seeks to correct for nonresponse bias using logistic regression models, but the following issues may still lead to racial or ethnic bias:

Differential response rates by race or ethnicity: Certain racial or ethnic groups may have lower response rates, potentially due to cultural differences, language barriers, or mistrust of surveys. If these differences are not adequately accounted for in the weighting adjustments, the dataset may misrepresent the health behaviors or outcomes of these groups.

Cultural differences in survey comprehension: Cultural factors may influence how respondents from different ethnic backgrounds understand or answer survey questions. If these cultural nuances are not properly considered in the survey design or the adjustment process, the resulting dataset could be biased, particularly for immigrant or minority populations.

6. Temporal Bias
Temporal bias can occur when the timing of data collection disproportionately affects certain groups or leads to inaccuracies. For instance, in surveys where data is collected over a period of time, the following biases could arise:

Seasonal effects: If data collection spans different seasons, certain behaviors or health outcomes (e.g., physical activity levels, respiratory conditions) might vary by season. If the timing of data collection is not accounted for properly in the nonresponse adjustment, this could lead to temporal bias in the results.

Period effects: If data collection occurs during an event or period of particular significance (e.g., a health crisis or political event), certain individuals may be more likely to respond, skewing the dataset. Temporal bias could distort the generalizability of findings to other periods.

7. Paradata-Related Bias
Paradata—information about the process of data collection, such as the number of contact attempts or the day/time of contact—helps adjust for nonresponse, but it can also introduce bias if misused:

Paradata misuse: If paradata such as the time of contact or the frequency of contact attempts are not fully integrated or misinterpreted in the weighting process, this could lead to an incorrect adjustment for nonresponse, particularly if these factors vary in their effects on different population groups.
8. Other Types of Bias
Other forms of bias may also impact the data, even if they are less common or harder to detect:

Examination bias: This type of bias can occur if certain respondents (such as those with better health or more access to healthcare) are more likely to be included in the survey. These individuals may be more likely to answer the questions accurately or be available for interviews, which could distort the final dataset’s health estimates.

Convenience bias: This type of bias arises when data is gathered from individuals who are more easily accessible or willing to participate. In the case of CCHS, this might occur if certain populations are more likely to be reached through telephone or in-person interviews, leaving out harder-to-reach groups.

Strengths and Weaknesses of CCHS Nonresponse Handling
Strengths
Use of Response Homogeneity Groups (RHGs): The CCHS utilizes response homogeneity groups (RHGs) to correct for household and person-level nonresponse. This method ensures that the sample is adjusted to reflect the response behavior of different subgroups, improving the representativeness of the final dataset.

Logistic Regression-Based Adjustment: By applying logistic regression models to predict the likelihood of response, CCHS effectively handles nonresponse bias. The models use a variety of factors, such as geographic information, collection period, and paradata, ensuring a robust approach to adjusting for nonrespondents with similar characteristics.

Two-Part Adjustment for Household and Person Nonresponse: The distinct handling of household nonresponse (via weight adjustment A6) and person nonresponse (via weight adjustment A9) ensures that both levels of nonresponse are addressed separately, which helps maintain the accuracy of estimates at both the household and individual levels.

Consideration of Paradata: The integration of paradata (e.g., number of contact attempts, time of contact, weekday/weekend contacts) into the adjustment process enhances the precision of the weighting, ensuring that nonresponse patterns are accurately captured and corrected.

Incorporation of Geographic and Demographic Variables: By including factors such as geographic location and household characteristics in the nonresponse adjustment models, CCHS enhances the likelihood that the adjusted sample is representative of diverse populations across different regions and demographic groups.

Weaknesses
Potential Residual Selection Bias: Despite adjustments, certain populations may still be underrepresented or excluded from the dataset, particularly those with less access to phones or those more likely to refuse participation. This residual selection bias could lead to underrepresentation of specific groups, such as low-income individuals, racial minorities, or transient populations, which may not be fully corrected by the weighting process.

Risk of Over-Adjustment: The use of multiple weighting adjustments, while intended to improve representativeness, can sometimes lead to overfitting or over-adjustment. This may result in a dataset that over-represents certain characteristics at the expense of others, especially if the logistic regression models are not perfectly specified or if important variables are omitted.

Response Bias Remains Uncorrected: Even with sophisticated adjustments, response bias—such as social desirability bias or recall bias—can still affect the dataset. Respondents may provide inaccurate or socially desirable answers, and the weighting adjustments cannot fully correct for these biases, especially if they are not uniform across all demographic groups.

Inability to Address Nonresponse for Hard-to-Reach Populations: Certain populations, such as homeless individuals or those without stable housing, may remain largely unreachable by traditional survey methods, despite efforts to adjust for nonresponse. As a result, the final dataset may still fail to capture the health behaviors or conditions of these hard-to-reach groups, introducing gaps in the dataset.

Potential Paradata Misinterpretation: While paradata is useful for correcting nonresponse bias, if paradata (such as time of contact or number of contact attempts) is misinterpreted or incorrectly weighted, it can lead to inaccurate adjustments. The impact of these factors may vary across different subgroups, and improper handling could skew the final results.

Racial and Ethnic Bias: Despite attempts to adjust for nonresponse, racial and ethnic minorities may still be underrepresented in the dataset if they are less likely to respond or if the survey fails to account for cultural nuances in question interpretation. This could lead to racial or ethnic bias, skewing findings about health behaviors or conditions in minority populations.

Measurement Bias: There is a risk of measurement bias if the survey instruments are not designed to account for cultural or language differences, or if interviewers unintentionally influence responses. This can lead to inaccurate data that affects the reliability of the results, particularly for marginalized groups.

Conclusion
While the CCHS employs a comprehensive and methodologically sound approach to handling nonresponse, there are still potential weaknesses in the adjustment process. These include the persistence of selection, response, and measurement biases, as well as challenges in fully representing certain hard-to-reach or underrepresented populations. Despite these weaknesses, the strengths of the CCHS nonresponse handling process, such as the use of RHGs and logistic regression models, help mitigate many of these issues and contribute to a dataset that is broadly representative, though not without limitations.

Report on the 2017-2018 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Methodology and Data Collection
Introduction
The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2017-2018 is a national survey designed to gather information about the health status, healthcare utilization, and lifestyle choices of Canadians. Conducted by Statistics Canada, the survey aimed to provide insights into the health of the Canadian population by collecting data on a variety of health-related factors, including chronic conditions, physical activity, mental health, and access to healthcare services. This report examines the methodology used in data collection, the handling of nonresponse, and the implications of these processes on the quality of the final dataset.

Survey Questions
The CCHS 2017-2018 included a wide range of questions to assess both the physical and mental health of respondents. Key areas of focus included:

General Health Status: Respondents were asked about their overall health, including self-reported diagnoses of chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and heart disease.
Health Behaviors: The survey inquired about lifestyle factors, such as smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity levels, and dietary practices.
Mental Health: Questions on mental well-being focused on the presence of mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, and stress.
Healthcare Access: Participants were asked about their use of healthcare services, including the frequency of doctor visits, hospital admissions, and medication usage.
Demographic Information: The survey collected detailed demographic data, including age, sex, educational attainment, income level, and employment status.
Social Determinants of Health: The survey also covered factors such as social support, housing, and community involvement that contribute to overall well-being.
This broad array of questions was designed to provide a comprehensive view of the health and social conditions affecting the Canadian population.

Data Collection Methodology
The CCHS was conducted through a combination of telephone and in-person interviews. The survey used a stratified random sampling method, ensuring that the sample represented the diverse population across Canada, including various regions and demographic groups. To address nonresponse and ensure the accuracy of the data, Statistics Canada employed complex weighting and adjustment techniques.

Handling of Nonresponse
Nonresponse, both at the household and individual levels, is a common challenge in survey-based research. In the CCHS, household nonresponse occurred when households refused to participate, provided unusable data, or could not be reached. To account for this, Statistics Canada applied weights to redistribute the nonresponse bias. These weights were calculated within Response Homogeneity Groups (RHGs), which were created based on characteristics such as geographic region, collection period, and other demographic factors. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the probability of response, and the weights were adjusted accordingly.

For person-level nonresponse, similar adjustment methods were employed. If an individual selected for the survey did not respond (either due to refusal or inability to contact them), the weights for responding individuals were adjusted based on response probabilities within their corresponding RHG. This ensured that the final dataset accurately reflected the population, despite missing data for some individuals.

Potential Biases in the Data
While the use of weighting adjustments helps to mitigate the effects of nonresponse, the CCHS data is still susceptible to several types of biases:

Selection Bias: The sampling process, though stratified, may not fully capture certain subgroups, particularly those that are harder to reach, such as marginalized populations or those living in remote areas. This could skew the results if these groups differ significantly from the general population in terms of health outcomes.
Response Bias: Nonresponse adjustments attempt to correct for this issue, but there remains a risk of response bias, especially if the nonrespondents differ systematically from respondents in ways that are not fully captured by the RHG variables.
Measurement Bias: Some questions, particularly those related to self-reported health status or behaviors, could be subject to measurement bias. For instance, respondents may underreport or overreport certain behaviors like alcohol consumption or smoking, leading to inaccurate data.
Social Desirability Bias: Respondents may be influenced by the desire to present themselves in a more favorable light, particularly on sensitive topics such as alcohol use or mental health issues. This can affect the accuracy of responses and, by extension, the analysis of these variables.
Impact on the Final Dataset
The nonresponse adjustments and weighting methods used in the CCHS help to reduce some of the potential biases introduced by nonresponse. However, the presence of selection and response biases could still influence the final dataset, particularly if certain population groups are underrepresented or if the nonresponse is not fully accounted for. Additionally, measurement bias could affect the accuracy of health-related data, particularly where self-reporting is involved.

While the adjustments made to the CCHS data improve its representativeness, it is important for users of the data to be aware of these potential biases when interpreting the results. The impact of these biases can vary depending on the specific analysis being conducted and the population being studied.

Conclusion
The CCHS 2017-2018 is a valuable tool for understanding the health and well-being of Canadians. By employing sophisticated sampling and nonresponse adjustment techniques, Statistics Canada has made significant efforts to ensure that the data is as representative as possible. However, potential biases—such as selection bias, response bias, and measurement bias—remain important considerations when using the dataset. Researchers should be cautious in interpreting the results and consider these biases in their analyses to ensure that conclusions drawn from the data are valid and reliable.
