The limitations of your paper could include:

Data Availability: Reliance on secondary data sources might limit the scope of analysis, especially if the data lacks granularity or has missing values.
Self-Reported Bias: Variables like physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking may be subject to self-reporting inaccuracies.
Cross-Sectional Nature: If the analysis is based on cross-sectional data, it cannot establish causation, only associations.
Unmeasured Confounders: Factors influencing physical activity, like weather, cultural norms, or mental health, might not be accounted for.
Generalizability: Findings might not extend beyond the Ontario population or the timeframe of the data.
Model Limitations: The assumptions of linear regression, such as linearity and homoscedasticity, may not hold, affecting model validity.

write out more comprehensively about self-reported bias from health data collected

Self-reported bias is a common limitation in health data collection, particularly when examining behaviors like physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Participants may overestimate or underestimate their activities due to memory recall issues, social desirability bias, or personal perceptions of what constitutes "healthy" behavior. For example, individuals might inflate their reported exercise levels or downplay unhealthy habits like smoking. Such inaccuracies can introduce systematic error, leading to biased estimates of associations and potentially undermining the validity of the study's conclusions. Mitigating this requires complementary objective measures, such as wearable activity trackers or biomarkers.
